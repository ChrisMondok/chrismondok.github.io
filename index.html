					<header> Crowd Fiend </header>

					<p>
					Crowd Fiend is a crowd-sourced demon-summoning game that you play on your phone.
					A large number of players connect to the game using their smartphones, and are distributed among two teams.
					After the game begins, every 20 seconds, they'll be given a ritual to fulfill.
					Whenever a player completes a ritual, their team's demon gains some points, allowing it to level up.
					After three minutes have elapsed, these demons use turn-based-RPG-style rules to attack each other.
					</p>

					<p>
					Crowd Fiend was created for Global Game Jam 2016, when the theme was "Ritual."
					When forming teams on site, it attracted a large number of people, and as a result had a total of nine contributors.
					The game concept came from Cory Williams, who pitched a game about summoning demons cooperatively with phones.
					I had pitched a different game where players would perform a large number of easy, but repetitive tasks, until they were overwhelmed.
					After hanging up posters to attract teams, we discovered that the two could be merged quite well, and thus Crowd Fiend was born.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Despite network issues at the GGJ site, we managed to get a game with 36 players in it at the time of the demo.
					A link to the event can be found below.
					I can't speak for the whole team, but personally I was extremely nervous: the most players we had ever tested with prior to the event was 8,
					and while testing was done on a LAN, when we presented the game it was done over the internet connecting to a Raspberry Pi 2 with a $5.00 wireless card.
					Despite our best efforts, everything went quite smoothly, and a good time was had by most.
					</p>

				<article id="zolf">
					<header> Zolf </header>

					<p>
					Zolf is a game about winning a round of golf during the zombie apocalypse.
					Like any golfing game, the objective is to hit the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible.
					Unlike any golfing game, you gain <em>negative</em> points for killing zombies by hitting them with a fast-moving golf ball.
					You also gain infinite points for getting eaten by zombies (making you lose at golf).
					</p>

					<p>
					Zolf was an entry for <a href="#ludum-dare">Ludum Dare</a> 32, where the theme was "an unconventional weapon."
					As a "Jam" entry, it had a 72 hour time line, and was allowed to be a team project.
					It was developed by a team of four:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> Chris Mondok - Programmer </li>
						<li> Bill Rossi - Programmer </li>
						<li> Ryan Shello - Music and SFX </li>
						<li> Miki Tharp - Art </li>
					</ul>

					<header> Sports Medley </header>

					<p>
					Sports Medley is a local multiplayer game in which players rapidly switch between playing hockey,
					dodgeball, kill the carrier, and "ultimate flying disc." There is a bonus round where everyone is
					playing every sport at once.
					</p>

					<p>
					Sports Medley was a Global Game Jam 2015 entry, where the theme was "what do we do now?". While it was a success at the jam, the peculiarities
					around the web gamepad API make it very difficult to get started. You can give it a shot if you like,
					or just watch <a href="https://youtu.be/5lNAtRrnpz8">this video</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sports Medley was designed and implemented by Chris Mondok and Justin Giannone. Graphics were provided by Ben Harris and Jon Echavarria.
						Brian Thompson created the audio. Nick Matthews provided the (mildly disturbing) game poster.

					<header> Snowman Race </header>

					<p>
					Snowman Race is an Next Generation Snowman Racing Simulator. Players use their smartphones as
					controllers to race to the end of a simple maze, gathering items to slow their enemies along the way.
					</p>

					<p>
					Snowman Race was created for the Ludum Dare Competition. As such, it was developed from scratch in 48 hours as a solo project.
					The theme of the competition was "entire game on one screen", which I took to mean a multiplayer game where everyone looked
					at the same screen. The winter asthetic came from a potential theme, which was simply "&#9731;" (the unicode snowman character).
					</p>

					<p>
					For reasons unknown, the game does not work on iPhones, nor on OSX. I was unable to research this during the duration of the jam,
					and indeed came to learn this afterwards when there were many confused commenters. If you want to give it a try, you'll be best
					off using Android phones, and Chrome or Firefox on Linux or Windows.

					<header> Tether </header>

					<p>
					In Tether, you play the pilot of a Planet Collector Tethercraft, gathering planets using a massive cable.
					The goal is to connect all of the planets in the level into one network. 
					</p>

					<p> Tether was a Ludum Dare Jam entry, in which the theme was "connected worlds". It was produced by a team of four: </p>

					<ul>
						<li> Chris Mondok - Developer </li>
						<li> Bill Rossi - Developer </li>
						<li> Miki Tharp - Art </li>
						<li> Ryan Shello - Music and sound effects </li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					On a personal note, I love how this game came together. By Saturday night, we thought the project would be a massive failure,
					and none of us could remember our high school physics. Despite that, we got everything working smoothly enough on Sunday,
					and things were looking a lot better. The graphics by Miki and the audio from Ryan really tie it together. We got the ability
					to have multiple levels, and then a win and loss condition, within the last hour of the jam.
					</p>

					<p> This game was also my first foray into the web audio API. </p>

					<header> Ham-3R </header>

					<p>
					HAM-3R is an abstract game about doing three things at once. Enemies (red squares) appear in a semicircle around the player's ship.
					They can be defeated by clicking on them, aiming and shooting at them, or by typing the words that appear above them.
					However, if you rely on one method of attack, it will become much harder. Every time the mouse is clicked, subsequent enemies become smaller.
					Each time the beam is fired, it becomes narrower. When words are typed, incoming enemies get longer and longer words.
					</p>

					<p>
					HAM-3R was created for Global Game Jam 2014. It was very well received, with other GGJ participants interrupting my progress to
					play it for themselves (which was always welcome). The game is intended to be played with a steering wheel, but it works fine with
					just a mouse and keyboard. The game was developed before any of my browsers had gamepad support, so using a wheel requires a Linux
					(or possibly OSX) server written in node. This server also acts as the highscore table, which is not set up in the online link provided below.
					</p>

					<p> Here are some videos of other people playing HAM-3R: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/CRlcWRyoa6k"> Video 1 </a> </li>

						<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/FiS94_thVUU"> Video 2 </a> </li>
					</ul>

					<p> The game was designed and developed by myself, with audio by Matt Strawder </p>

					<header> Pinger </header>

					<p>
					Pinger is a game about using triangulation to locate gold while avoiding water and mining as little dirt as possible.
					By deploying a sort of sonar pulse, the player can see how far they are from pieces of gold. By deploying pulses from different
					locations, they can figure out the precise locations of these gold pieces.
					</p>

					<p> It was created for the Ludum Dare 29 competition, and was a great success, earning 29th place, out of over 2000 participants. (Amusingly, I did not notice this coincidence until writing this document.) </p>

					<header> Park-King </header>

					<p>
					Park-King is a sliding puzzle game about managing a busy parking lot. The player arranges cars as they arrive, but they will need to depart out-of-order.
					Additionally, there is a period of time in which the player must break for lunch, and cannot do anything for a few moments.
					</p>

					<p> The game is played by carefully dragging cars around with the mouse. There is no requirement as to where the cars are placed, so long as they can depart in time. </p>

					<p>
					Park-King was an entry in the Ludum Dare 28, where the theme was "You Only Get One". I had interpreted this to mean that the player character only gets one break
					from his job, his lunch break at 1:00 PM.
					</p>
					Park-King was my first Ludum Dare project. Reception was mixed: some players found the game amusing (and even addicitive).
					Others had absolutely no idea what was going on. The in-game tutorial is confusing, not to mention cringe-worthy.
					While I enjoyed this project, it was a harsh realization that I need to be extremely clear in describing how to play my games in the future.

					<header> Ballin Spain </header>

					<p>
						Ballin Spain is a game about bouncing a guacamole-colored ball off the top of the screen as quickly as possible.
						Some of the platforms in the game are not what they seem.
					</p>

					<p> Ballin Spain was created for the 2010 Global Game Jam, where the theme was deception. It was developed by a team of 6: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Brian Wilbur </li>
						<li> Chris Mondok </li>
						<li> Ian Dunlap </li>
						<li> Ivan Potosky </li>
						<li> Kevin Anderson </li>
						<li> Zach Pinner </li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This was my first game jam, and while I was skeptical going in, I have attended every game jam I can since. I highly recommend attending one,
						even if you think you have little to bring to the table. You'd be surprised what you can learn, and they're great fun.

					<header> Font Viewer </header>

					<p>
					Font Viewer is a simple utility for comparing fonts.
					You pick some fonts from your computer, you enter some text, and you can quickly switch between them to compare them.
					There's no server involved, all it does is add the fonts to the page.
					</p>

					<p>
					Font Viewer was created to analyze the differences we were about to encounter when switching font formats in my project at work.
					It was largely developed due to the fact that Windows 8's built in font viewer didn't know what to do with .woff files,
					and most available projects looked like they'd also install malware on my machine.
