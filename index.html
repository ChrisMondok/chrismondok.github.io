					<header> Zolf </header>

					<p>
					Zolf is a game about winning a round of golf during the zombie apocalypse.
					Like any golfing game, the objective is to hit the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible.
					Unlike any golfing game, you gain <em>negative</em> points for killing zombies by hitting them with a fast-moving golf ball.
					You also gain infinite points for getting eaten by zombies (making you lose at golf).
					</p>

					<p>
					Zolf was an entry for <a href="#ludum-dare">Ludum Dare</a> 32, where the theme was "an unconventional weapon."
					As a "Jam" entry, it had a 72 hour time line, and was allowed to be a team project.
					It was developed by a team of four:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> Chris Mondok - Programmer </li>
						<li> Bill Rossi - Programmer </li>
						<li> Ryan Shello - Music and SFX </li>
						<li> Miki Tharp - Art </li>
					</ul>

					<header> Sports Medley </header>

					<p>
					Sports Medley is a local multiplayer game in which players rapidly switch between playing hockey,
					dodgeball, kill the carrier, and "ultimate flying disc." There is a bonus round where everyone is
					playing every sport at once.
					</p>

					<p>
					Sports Medley was a Global Game Jam 2015 entry, where the theme was "what do we do now?". While it was a success at the jam, the peculiarities
					around the web gamepad API make it very difficult to get started. You can give it a shot if you like,
					or just watch <a href="https://youtu.be/5lNAtRrnpz8">this video</a>.
					</p>

					<p> Sports Medley was designed and implemented by Chris Mondok and Justin Giannone. Graphics were provided by Ben Harris and Jon Echavarria. Brian Thompson created the audio.</p>

					<header> Snowman Race </header>

					<p>
					Snowman Race is an Next Generation Snowman Racing Simulator. Players use their smartphones as
					controllers to race to the end of a simple maze, gathering items to slow their enemies along the way.
					</p>

					<p>
					Snowman Race was created for the Ludum Dare Competition. As such, it was developed from scratch in 48 hours as a solo project.
					The theme of the competition was "entire game on one screen", which I took to mean a multiplayer game where everyone looked
					at the same screen. The winter asthetic came from a potential theme, which was simply "&#9731;" (the unicode snowman character).
					</p>

					<p>
					For reasons unknown, the game does not work on iPhones, nor on OSX. I was unable to research this during the duration of the jam,
					and indeed came to learn this afterwards when there were many confused commenters. If you want to give it a try, you'll be best
					off using Android phones, and Chrome or Firefox on Linux or Windows.

				<article id="tether">
					<header> Tether </header>

					<p>
					In Tether, you play the pilot of a Planet Collector Tethercraft, gathering planets using a massive cable.
					The goal is to connect all of the planets in the level into one network. 
					</p>

					<p> Tether was a Ludum Dare Jam entry, in which the theme was "connected worlds". It was produced by a team of four: </p>

					<ul>
						<li> Chris Mondok - Developer </li>
						<li> Bill Rossi - Developer </li>
						<li> Miki Tharp - Art </li>
						<li> Ryan Shello - Music and sound effects </li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					On a personal note, I love how this game came together. By Saturday night, we thought the project would be a massive failure,
					and none of us could remember our high school physics. Despite that, we got everything working smoothly enough on Sunday,
					and things were looking a lot better. The graphics by Miki and the audio from Ryan really tie it together. We got the ability
					to have multiple levels, and then a win and loss condition, within the last hour of the jam.
					</p>

					<p> This game was also my first foray into the web audio API. </p>

					<header> Ham-3R </header>

					<p>
						HAM-3R is an abstract game about doing three things at once. Enemies (red squares) appear in a semicircle around the player's ship.
						They can be defeated by clicking on them, aiming and shooting at them, or by typing the words that appear above them.
						However, if you rely on one method of attack, it will become much harder. Every time the mouse is clicked, subsequent enemies become smaller.
						Each time the beam is fired, it becomes narrower. When words are typed, incoming enemies get longer and longer words.
					</p>

					<p>
						HAM-3R was created for Global Game Jam 2014. It was very well received, with other GGJ participants interrupting my progress to
						play it for themselves (which was always welcome). The game is intended to be played with a steering wheel, but it works fine with
						just a mouse and keyboard. The game was developed before any of my browsers had gamepad support, so using a wheel requires a Linux
						(or possibly OSX) server written in node. This server also acts as the highscore table, which is not set up in the online link provided below.
					</p>

					<p> Here are some videos of other people playing HAM-3R: </p>

						<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/FiS94_thVUU"> Video 2 </a> </li>
					</ul>

					<p> The game was designed and developed by myself, with audio by Matt Strawder </p>

					<header> Pinger </header>

					<p>
						Pinger is a game about using triangulation to locate gold while avoiding water and mining as little dirt as possible.
						By deploying a sort of sonar pulse, the player can see how far they are from pieces of gold. By deploying pulses from different
						locations, they can figure out the precise locations of these gold pieces.
					</p>

					<p> It was created for the Ludum Dare 29 competition, and was a great success, earning 29th place, out of over 2000 participants. (Amusingly, I did not notice this coincidence until writing this document.) </p>

					<header> Park-King </header>

					<p>
						Park-King is a sliding puzzle game about managing a busy parking lot. The player arranges cars as they arrive, but they will need to depart out-of-order.
					</p>

					<p> The game is played by carefully dragging cars around with the mouse. There is no requirement as to where the cars are placed, so long as they can depart in time. </p>

					<p>
						Park-King was an entry in the Ludum Dare 28, and it was my first Ludum Dare project. Reception was mixed: some players found the game amusing (and even addicitive).
						Others had absolutely no idea what was going on. The in-game tutorial is confusing, not to mention cringe-worthy. While I enjoyed this project, it was a harsh realization
						that I need to be extremely clear in describing how to play my games in the future.
					</p>
