        Park-King is a sliding puzzle game about managing a busy parking lot. The player arranges cars as they arrive, but they will need to depart out-of-order.
        Additionally, there is a period of time in which the player must break for lunch, and cannot do anything for a few moments.
        </p>

        <p> The game is played by carefully dragging cars around with the mouse. There is no requirement as to where the cars are placed, so long as they can depart in time. </p>

        Park-King was an entry in the Ludum Dare 28, where the theme was "You Only Get One". I had interpreted this to mean that the player character only gets one break
        from his job, his lunch break at 1:00 PM.
        </p>
        Park-King was my first Ludum Dare project. Reception was mixed: some players found the game amusing (and even addicitive).
        Others had absolutely no idea what was going on. The in-game tutorial is confusing, not to mention cringe-worthy.
        While I enjoyed this project, it was a harsh realization that I need to be extremely clear in describing how to play my games in the future.
