        Snowman Race is an Next Generation Snowman Racing Simulator. Players use their smartphones as
        controllers to race to the end of a simple maze, gathering items to slow their enemies along the way.

        <p>
        Snowman Race was created for the Ludum Dare Competition. As such, it was developed from scratch in 48 hours as a solo project.
        The theme of the competition was "entire game on one screen", which I took to mean a multiplayer game where everyone looked
        at the same screen. The winter asthetic came from a potential theme, which was simply "&#9731;" (the unicode snowman character).
        </p>

        <p>
        For reasons unknown, the game does not work on iPhones, nor on OSX. I was unable to research this during the duration of the jam,
        and indeed came to learn this afterwards when there were many confused commenters. If you want to give it a try, you'll be best
        off using Android phones, and Chrome or Firefox on Linux or Windows.
