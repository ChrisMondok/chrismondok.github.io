        Sports Medley is a local multiplayer game in which players rapidly switch between playing hockey,
        dodgeball, kill the carrier, and "ultimate flying disc." There is a bonus round where everyone is
        playing every sport at once.

        Sports Medley was a Global Game Jam 2015 entry, where the theme was "what do we do now?". While it was a success at the jam, the peculiarities
        around the web gamepad API make it very difficult to get started. You can give it a shot if you like,
        or just watch <a href="https://youtu.be/5lNAtRrnpz8">this video</a>.

        Sports Medley was designed and implemented by Chris Mondok and Justin Giannone. Graphics were provided by Ben Harris and Jon Echavarria.
        Brian Thompson created the audio. Nick Matthews provided the (mildly disturbing) <a href="poster.png">game poster</a>.
