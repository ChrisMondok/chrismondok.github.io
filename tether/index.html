        In Tether, you play the pilot of a Planet Collector Tethercraft, gathering planets using a massive cable.
        The goal is to connect all of the planets in the level into one network. 
        </p>

        <p> Tether was a Ludum Dare Jam entry, in which the theme was "connected worlds". It was produced by a team of four: </p>

        <ul>
          <li> Chris Mondok - Developer </li>
          <li> Bill Rossi - Developer </li>
          <li> Miki Tharp - Art </li>
          <li> Ryan Shello - Music and sound effects </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        On a personal note, I love how this game came together. By Saturday night, we thought the project would be a massive failure,
        and none of us could remember our high school physics. Despite that, we got everything working smoothly enough on Sunday,
        and things were looking a lot better. The graphics by Miki and the audio from Ryan really tie it together. We got the ability
        to have multiple levels, and then a win and loss condition, within the last hour of the jam.
        </p>

        <p> This game was also my first foray into the web audio API. </p>
